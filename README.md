# Decrypter
According to Mozilla, decryption is the conversion of ciphertext into Plaintext. Decryption is a cryptographic primitive: it transforms a ciphertext message into plaintext using a cryptographic algorithm called a cipher.

# Programming Language Used
Python

# How to run this program
1. Open a text editor such as Notepad, Sublime Text, or VS Code.
2. Copy the code you provided and paste it into a new file in the text editor.
3. Save the file with a .py extension, such as decrypt_message.py.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the .py file using the cd command.
6. Type python decrypt_message.py (or whatever you named the file) in the terminal or command prompt and press Enter.
7. The program should now start running, and it will prompt you to enter your course name and a ciphertext message to decrypt. Follow the prompts and enter the necessary information.
8. After you have entered a message to decrypt, the program will display the decrypted message and ask if you want to decrypt another message. Enter y to decrypt another message or n to exit the program.
That's it!

# About me
Hi, my name is Derick Carlo S. Herrera and I am a computer engineering student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I created this decrypter program as a way to challenge myself and apply the knowledge I have gained from my studies. As a student, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and this project allowed me to practice my coding abilities while also helping others by providing a tool to decrypt messages. It was a fun and rewarding experience to see the code come to life and I hope to continue learning and growing as a programmer.
